In this post, we will learn how to create our own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV. 
Here I have written this code in Python because python provides exhaustive and sufficient library to build this program. 
Here, we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation. In order to run this code , you need a mp4 video named "video.mp4". You must have a cloth of same color and no other color shoulf be there. 
I am taking red cloth. If you are taking some other cloth , the code will remain the same but with minute changes.
